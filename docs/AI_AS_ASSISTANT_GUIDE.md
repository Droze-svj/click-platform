# AI as Assistant, Not Replacement

Use AI to **generate rough clips and suggestions**, then **you** refine: fix cuts, adjust framing, redesign captions, swap B-roll, and choose segments by **strategy**—not only score. Test multiple versions and keep what actually performs.

## 1. Let AI generate rough clips, then manually refine

- **AI does:** Rough cuts, silence removal, first pass at pacing, suggested segments, auto-captions, style suggestions.
- **You do:**
  - **Fix awkward cuts and pacing** – Nudge in/out points, add or remove beats so it feels right.
  - **Adjust framing/crops** – Reframe for 9:16, center key action, fix crops that feel off.
  - **Redesign captions, colors, and overlays** – Apply your own style; AI is a starting point, not the final look.
  - **Replace generic B-roll** – Swap suggested or stock B-roll with more relevant or custom footage that matches your message.

Treat AI output as a **draft**. Your judgment on pacing, framing, and style is what makes it yours.

## 2. Use AI transcripts to find moments—choose by strategy, not only “viral score”

- **Transcripts** – Use AI-generated transcripts to quickly jump to moments (quotes, key lines, questions).
- **Segments** – AI may suggest segments by engagement or “viral” score; use that as **input**, not the only rule.
- **Strategy** – Choose segments based on **your** goals: teach one thing, land one CTA, match a platform (TikTok vs Reels vs Shorts), or fit a series. Score is a hint; strategy is the decision.

So: use AI to **find** and **suggest**; you decide **what to keep** and **why**.

## 3. Test multiple versions and keep what performs

- **Hook variants** – Try different first 3 seconds (different hook line or visual) and compare.
- **Caption variants** – Test different caption styles or key-word emphasis on the same clip.
- **First frame / thumbnail** – Test 2–3 options and see which stops the scroll.
- **Measure** – Use platform analytics (retention, completion, saves, shares) to see what actually performs.
- **Keep what works** – Double down on the version that performs; don’t default to the first draft.

AI can suggest; you test and decide.

## Quick checklist

| Step | AI | You |
|------|----|-----|
| **Clips** | Rough clips, suggested cuts | Fix awkward cuts/pacing, adjust framing/crops |
| **Look** | Default captions, colors, overlays | Redesign in your style; replace generic B-roll |
| **Segments** | Transcript + suggested moments (e.g. by score) | Choose by strategy, not only score |
| **Versions** | Suggestions for hook/captions | Test multiple variants; keep what performs |

**Bottom line:** AI is your **assistant**. You are the **editor**—refine, choose, and test so the final cut is intentional and on-brand.
