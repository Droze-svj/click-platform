# Visual Polish Beyond Templates

Build a **recognizable style** and consistent, platform-ready output. This guide covers brand lock-in, meaningful motion, framing, and transitions.

## 1. Lock in consistent brand elements

Use the same choices across videos so your content looks like *you*:

- **Colors** – Primary and accent (e.g. hex) for captions, lower thirds, and accents.
- **Fonts** – One or two families for titles, lower thirds, and body/captions.
- **Lower-third style** – Position (left/right/centered), background (bar, pill, transparent), and animation (fade, slide).
- **Logo placement** – Fixed corner or position (e.g. top-right, bottom-right) and size/opacity.
- **Caption style** – Font, size, position (bottom-center, lower-third, full-width), and highlight/outline.

**In the product:** Save these in your Brand kit or style preset and apply the same preset to each project so exports stay consistent.

## 2. Meaningful motion: zooms, push-ins, and crops

Use **subtle but purposeful** motion to emphasize key words or reactions instead of constant random movement:

- **When to use:** Key line, punchline, reaction, or important moment—not every few seconds.
- **Subtle zooms (e.g. 1.05–1.15x)** – Short push-in on a key phrase or beat.
- **Push-ins** – Slight scale-up into the frame to land a point.
- **Crops/reframes** – Tighten on the subject or face when it matters.

**Avoid:** Continuous Ken Burns, drifting pans, or motion on every clip. Less motion with intent beats constant motion.

## 3. Match framing to platform

- **9:16 vertical** – Default for Reels, TikTok, Shorts. Use 9:16 for short-form.
- **Safe text area** – Keep important text and graphics out of:
  - **Bottom ~20%** – UI overlays (like, comment, profile).
  - **Top ~10%** – Notch/status area on some devices.
- **Key action in center 80%** – Compose so the main subject and action sit in the middle 80% of the frame so nothing critical is covered by platform UI.

**In the editor:** Use the vertical/9:16 preset and the safe-zone hints (thumb-safe, center 80%) when placing text and logos.

## 4. Keep transitions simple and clean

Trends lean toward **minimalist edits** that serve the message:

- **Preferred:** Cut, cross-dissolve (fade), short dip to black. Quick and invisible.
- **Use sparingly:** Slide, subtle zoom transition—only when they add meaning.
- **Avoid:** Flashy wipes, spins, or long transitions that call attention to the edit instead of the content.

**Rule of thumb:** If the transition is the first thing viewers notice, simplify it.

## Quick checklist

| Area | Do | Avoid |
|------|----|--------|
| **Brand** | Same colors, fonts, lower-third, logo, caption style every time | Mixing styles randomly per video |
| **Motion** | Subtle zooms/push-ins on key words or reactions | Constant or random movement |
| **Framing** | 9:16 for short-form; key action in center 80%; text in safe area | Critical content in bottom 20% or edges |
| **Transitions** | Cut, fade, minimal | Flashy wipes and long transitions |
