# Platform-Native Optimization

Optimize **per platform** instead of one generic export. Format correctly, make the first frame scroll-stopping, use captions designed for silent viewing, and tweak for each audience.

---

## 1. Optimize for each platform (not one generic export)

- **TikTok** – Fast cuts, trending sounds, captions that pop. CTAs like “Follow for more,” “Duet this,” “Comment below.”
- **Instagram Reels** – Aesthetic consistency, strong first frame, captions and hashtags. CTAs: “Save this,” “Share with someone who needs this,” “Follow.”
- **YouTube Shorts** – Clear value in the first second, hook + payoff. CTAs: “Subscribe,” “Like,” “Turn on notifications.”

Export **separately** per platform when possible, or use platform presets (TikTok / Reels / Shorts) so format and feel match.

## 2. Format correctly

- **9:16 vertical** – Standard for TikTok, Reels, Shorts.
- **At least 1080p** – 1080×1920 (vertical) so quality holds up.
- **30 fps** – Smooth and widely supported; avoid 24 fps for short-form unless intentional.
- **Reasonable file size** – Bitrate high enough for quality but not so high that platforms re-encode and compress badly (e.g. 3–5 Mbps for vertical 1080p). Use platform presets so uploads don’t get crushed.

## 3. First frame + thumbnail = scroll-stopping

- **Bold text** – One clear line (question, number, or promise) so the feed frame reads at a glance.
- **Clear visual** – Face, product, or key action visible; not a random or empty frame.
- **Not random** – Prefer the opening frame (0:00) or a chosen moment that sums up the video, not a generic mid-video frame.

Use analysis “thumbnail moments” and export settings to pick or generate a **scroll-stopping** first frame and thumbnail.

## 4. Burned-in, concise captions (silent viewing)

- **Burned-in** – Captions in the video so they work with sound off (Reels, TikTok, Shorts).
- **Concise** – Short phrases, not walls of text; easy to read in one glance.
- **Key words emphasized** – Bold or highlight the 1–3 words that carry the meaning.
- **Enough time to read** – On-screen long enough; not flashing by. Sync to speech but allow a beat for reading.

Design for **silent viewing** first; then they also work with sound on.

---

## 5. Slightly tweak per platform (TikTok vs Reels vs Shorts)

- **Cuts** – TikTok: snappier; Reels: can be slightly longer beats; Shorts: clear segments (hook → value → CTA).
- **Titles / in-video text** – Match tone: TikTok = casual/direct; Reels = aspirational or relatable; Shorts = clear value (“How to…”, “Why…”).
- **CTAs** – TikTok: “Follow,” “Comment,” “Duet”; Reels: “Save,” “Share,” “Follow”; Shorts: “Subscribe,” “Like,” “Turn on notifications.”

Small tweaks make the same content feel **native** to each audience.

## Quick checklist

| Area | Do | Avoid |
|------|----|--------|
| **Export** | One export per platform or use platform presets (TikTok / Reels / Shorts) | One generic export for all |
| **Format** | 9:16, 1080p, 30 fps, reasonable bitrate | Low res, wrong aspect, huge files that get re-compressed |
| **First frame** | Bold text + clear visual; scroll-stopping | Random or empty frame |
| **Captions** | Burned-in, concise, key words emphasized, enough time to read | Long blocks, no emphasis, too fast to read |
| **Per platform** | Slightly different cuts, titles, CTAs per platform | Same edit and CTA everywhere |
