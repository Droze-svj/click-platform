# Premium Audio Guide

Make audio feel **premium**: clean voice, music that serves the story, SFX that land, and a mix that works on phone speakers.

---

## 1. Prioritize clean voice

- **Reduce noise** – Use noise reduction (e.g. afftdn) so dialogue is clear, not hissy or roomy.
- **Tame harsh frequencies** – Gentle cut in the 3–6 kHz range or a soft de-esser so speech isn’t brittle or fatiguing.
- **Keep speech clearly louder than music** – Duck music under dialogue so the voice is always the focus. Don’t let the track run at full level under talking.

**In the product:** Enable “Enhance audio” and “Noise reduction”; always enable “Audio ducking” when there’s music + speech.

## 2. Music that fits the emotion + cut to the beat

- **Match music to the emotion** – Choose tracks that fit the mood (energy, tone) of the content, not random background.
- **Cut visuals to the beat** – Sync cuts and key moments to the music’s beats so the edit feels intentional. Don’t just let the track run under everything.

**In the product:** Use sentiment/mood when auto-selecting music; use beat detection to suggest cut points or to align cuts in the timeline.

## 3. SFX sparingly but precisely

- **Whooshes on cuts** – Short whooshes or sweeps on transitions, not on every cut.
- **Hits on key words or transitions** – One hit on a punchline or key moment, not on every word.
- **Intentional, not spammy** – Fewer, well-placed SFX feel premium; too many feel cheap.

**In the product:** Add whooshes only at meaningful cuts; use impact/hit SFX for key words or scene changes. Avoid stacking multiple SFX at once.

## 4. Always mix for mobile

- **Check on a phone speaker** – Short-form is consumed on phones. If it’s muddy or quiet there, it’s wrong.
- **Target loudness** – Short-form often uses around -14 LUFS so playback is consistent and clear.
- **Clarity on small speakers** – Avoid heavy sub-bass; ensure mids and presence are clear so speech and key sounds read on a tiny driver.

**In the product:** Normalize for mobile-friendly LUFS (-14 for short-form); highpass rumble; reference the mix on a phone when possible.

## Quick checklist

| Area | Do | Avoid |
|------|----|--------|
| **Voice** | Noise reduction, tame harsh, duck music under speech | Music competing with dialogue; brittle or noisy voice |
| **Music** | Fit emotion; cut to the beat | Letting the track just run under everything |
| **SFX** | Whooshes on cuts; hits on key words/transitions | SFX on every cut or word (spammy) |
| **Mobile** | Mix for phone speaker; -14 LUFS for short-form; clear mids | Mixing only on headphones; too much bass |
