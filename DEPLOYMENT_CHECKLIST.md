## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Engineers
- Deploy first, then set up infrastructure (easier to test)
- Use free tiers for everything (upgrade later if needed)
- Set up keep-alive immediately (UptimeRobot - free)

### For Marketers
- Start with one platform (LinkedIn is easiest)
- Test each platform as you set it up
- Don't worry about getting all platforms at once - you can add more later

### For Teams
- Engineer does deployment (Steps 1-2) in morning
- Marketer does OAuth setup (Step 3) in afternoon
- Team starts creating content (Step 4) same day
